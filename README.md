This project as a part of a course with Yaniv Arad.
I created a Web application for Movies & Subscription management.

The Front End layer implemented with React and the Back End implemented with Google
Firebase.

Only authorized users can log in to the web site.
The Admin brings a username (this the requirement project).
after the user have the username he can to register to the system with default permissions (view movies and view subscription) changes in permissions depended on the Admin.

All the possible permission :
o “View Subscriptions”
o “Create Subscriptions”
o “Delete Subscriptions”
o “View Movies”
o “Create Movies”
o “Delete Movies”

For try: 
Permissions: view movies & view subscriptions:
user name: user@gmail.com
password: 123456

All permissions (without user management):
user name: adar@gmail.com
password: 123456
